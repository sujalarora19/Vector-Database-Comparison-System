## About
This project allows you to upload PDF/CSV files, extract text, store them in three different vector databases (Chroma, FAISS, Annoy), and compare their performance in answering user questions.



## Features
- Upload Files: Upload PDF or CSV files containing text data.
- Vector Database Support: Supports three vector databases for storage and retrieval:
   - Chroma
   - FAISS
   - Annoy
- Question Answering: Perform question answering on uploaded documents using stored vectors.
P- erformance Comparison: Compare response times and answers from all three vector databases.

      streamlit run main.py

2. Upload PDF/CSV Files:

- Upload one or more PDF or CSV files containing text data.
- Adjust chunk size and overlap as needed for text processing.

3. Choose Models:

- Enter the embedding model (default: models/embedding-001).
- Enter the completion model (default: gemini-pro).
- Adjust temperature and top K for question answering.

4. Submit & Process:

- Click on the "Submit & Process" button to start vectorization and indexing.
- Wait for processing to complete.

5. Ask a Question:

- Enter a question related to the uploaded documents.
- The system will display answers and query times from all three vector databases.

### Example Usage

- Here's an example of how to run the system:

- Upload example.pdf and data.csv.
- Set embedding model to models/embedding-001.
- Set completion model to gemini-pro.
- Adjust temperature to 0.3 and top K to 5.
- Click "Submit & Process".
- Ask a question in the text input field.
- View answers and response times displayed for Chroma, FAISS, and Annoy.
