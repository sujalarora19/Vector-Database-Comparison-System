    "## 2. Justification for Selecting Specific Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speed of Query Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "- Justification: The speed of query execution is a critical metric as it directly impacts the responsiveness and user experience of the system. Faster query times enable more efficient data retrieval, which is essential for real-time applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and interactive AI tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalability Under Varying Loads\n",
    "- Justification: Scalability is important to ensure the system can handle increasing amounts of data and user queries without degradation in performance. Assessing scalability helps in understanding the capacity of each vector database to maintain performance levels as data volumes and query loads grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy of Retrieved Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Justification: Accuracy is crucial for ensuring the relevance and precision of the search results. High accuracy means the system can retrieve the most relevant vectors that match the query, which is essential for applications like recommendation systems, document retrieval, and similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Recommendations for Potential Use Cases Based on Observed Performance Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chroma\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Cases: Chroma is recommended for applications that require persistent storage of large-scale vector data with frequent querying needs. It is suitable for enterprise search systems, large-scale recommendation engines, and any use case where scalability and consistent performance are critical.\n",
    "- Observations: Chroma showed good balance in query execution speed and scalability. It is ideal for scenarios where persistent storage and retrieval of vectors are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### FAISS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Cases: FAISS is ideal for high-performance applications needing fast and accurate nearest neighbor searches. It is well-suited for machine learning model inference, image and video similarity searches, and any application requiring high-speed data retrieval from large datasets.\n",
    "- Observations: FAISS demonstrated excellent query speed and accuracy. It is recommended for use cases that demand high performance and precise results, even at the cost of higher memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Annoy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Cases: Annoy is recommended for real-time applications where speed is crucial, and approximate results are acceptable. It is suitable for interactive applications, real-time recommendation systems, and scenarios where low-latency responses are more important than perfect accuracy.\n",
    "- Observations: Annoy provided the fastest query times but with slightly lower accuracy. It is ideal for use cases where quick, approximate results are preferred over perfect accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
